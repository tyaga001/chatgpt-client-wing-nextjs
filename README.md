# Building a ChatGPT Client with Wing and NextJs

This repository contains the source code for a web-based ChatGPT client developed using Wing and NextJs. This project demonstrates how to integrate OpenAI's language model (ChatGPT) with a modern NextJs frontend, utilizing Wing as the backend framework for efficient server-client communication.

## Features

- **ChatGPT Integration**: Leverage the power of OpenAI's ChatGPT for generating human-like text responses.
- **NextJs Frontend**: A clean and responsive UI built with NextJs.
- **Wing Backend**: Efficient handling of API requests and responses using Wing.
- **Real-time Interaction**: Smooth and real-time chatting experience.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- npm or Yarn
- Python 3.x

## Setup Instructions

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatgpt-client-wing-react.git
cd chatgpt-client-wing-nextjs

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the Backend Directory:

cd backend

Run the Wing server:
