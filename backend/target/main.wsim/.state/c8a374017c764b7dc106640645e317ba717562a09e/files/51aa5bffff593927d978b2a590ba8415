Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that are capable of creating original content, such as text, images, or music, rather than simply imitating existing data. These systems use sophisticated algorithms to generate new and unique output based on the patterns they have learned from a training dataset. This allows them to produce novel and creative content without direct human input.
