Some publicly available large language models include OpenAI's GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3), Google's BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), and Facebook's RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach). These models have been pre-trained on vast amounts of text data and are capable of generating human-like text.
